# altGPT

altGPT scans a webpage to find all images and generates missing `alt` text using an open source language model.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Enter the URL of the page you want to analyze.
3. Click **Let's rock** to fetch the page and inspect each image.
4. For images without an `alt` attribute, the tool generates a suggestion and displays it in a table.
5. Click **Copy** to copy a suggested `alt` text or **Download CSV** to download all results.

Internet access is required to fetch the target page and load the LLM.
